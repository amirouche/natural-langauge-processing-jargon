* Natural Language Processing Jargon

Natural Langauge Processing (NLP) is a wonderful science and
engineering field, and its popularity has been increasing as a
result. However, each comes with its own unique jargon and NLP is no
exception. By providing a glossary, we hope to make learning NLP
easier.

This is a WIP; please feel free to send a PR ;)

This is inspired from functional programming jargon
cf. https://github.com/hemanth/functional-programming-jargon

* How to contribute

Each item in the glossary must:

- fix spelling and grammar
- link to wikipedia
- explain each term in simple terms
- refer to other terms with an explanations
- link to scientific papers and/or free course materials

# AI-Complete

In the field of artificial intelligence, the most difficult problems
are informally known as AI-complete or AI-hard, implying that the
difficulty of these computational problems is equivalent to that of
solving the central artificial intelligence problemâ€”making computers
as intelligent as people, or
[strong AI](#artificial-general-intelligence). To call a problem
AI-complete reflects an attitude that it would not be solved by a
simple specific algorithm

AI-complete problems are hypothesised to include computer vision,
natural language understanding, and dealing with unexpected
circumstances while solving any real world problem.

[wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI-complete)

# Artificial General Intelligence

Artificial general intelligence (AGI) is the intelligence of a
(hypothetical) machine that could successfully perform any
intellectual task that a human being can. It is a primary goal of
artificial intelligence research and an important topic for science
fiction writers and futurists. Artificial general intelligence is also
referred to as "strong AI", "full AI" or as the ability of a
machine to perform "general intelligent action".

Some references emphasize a distinction between strong AI and "applied
AI" (also called "narrow AI" or "weak AI"): the use of software to
study or accomplish specific problem solving or reasoning tasks. Weak
AI, in contrast to strong AI, does not attempt to perform the full
range of human cognitive abilities.
